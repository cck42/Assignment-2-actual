#### Assignment 2, BIS 557

This package is in response to assignment 2 in BIS 557. A few notes:

The function ridge_regress() performs the ridge regression. It references ridge, which is a function that produces estimators for a series of lambda values.  

The vingettes folder holds the solutions to the written theory questions. The homework-2 file is incomplete, but was pushed before midnight. The homework-2-complete file is complete but  was submitted late (after midnight on 10/23). I separated it in order to have a separate timestamp, so it was clear what I completed on-time and what was late.
